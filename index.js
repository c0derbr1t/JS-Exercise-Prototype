  TASK 1
    *- Write a Person Constructor that initializes `name` and `age` from arguments.
    *- All instances of Person should initialize with an empty `stomach` array.
    *- Give instances of Person the ability to `.eat("someFood")`:
        + When eating an edible, it should be pushed into the `stomach`.
        + The `eat` method should have no effect if there are 10 items in the `stomach`.
    *- Give instances of Person the ability to `.poop()`:
        + When an instance poops, its `stomach` should empty.
    - Give instances of Person a method `.toString()`:
        + It should return a string with `name` and `age`. Example: "Mary, 50"

/* 
  TASK 4

  In your own words explain the four principles for the "this" keyword below:

  1. Global Binding: When *this* is called without something higher to bind to, it will tie to the window/console...it returns ALL of JS.

  2. Implicit Binding: Inside of a function in an object/function, it will bind to that object/function.

  3. New Binding: This is inside of a Constructor Function. It binds new properties to objects made with it by using *this* in the constructor.
  
  4. Explicit Binding: This overrides other binding by telling it specifically what to bind to when you call it.
